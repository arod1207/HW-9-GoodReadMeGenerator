# README Generator
    
## This readme generator runs on node.js and takes user input and generates a readme.md file.  The generator will ask for your GitHub user name and call the GitHub API and return some user information that can be used to generate the file. The generated file also populates github mark down to have a great looking README.md file.

## Usage
 ### To use the application, open up the command line and type "node index.js".  Enter a valid GitHub user name, and enter a valid repository name.
